            <p style="width: 70%; text-align:center; font-size: 22; margin-left: 13%; line-height: 2.5;"> During the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Dallas Touch-A-Life team executed a project to donate 5000 masks for Dallas ISD. Hit extremely hard by the pandemic, most students in the district cannot afford to buy laptops or reliable internet, and could not be involved with the virtual school year. To accomodate for those who could not afford the demands of a virtual year, the team donated these masks to allow those attending in person school to learn in a safer environment.  </p>

            <p style="width: 70%; text-align:center; font-size: 22; margin-left: 13%; line-height: 2.5;">  A large amount of people during the coronavirus pandemic lacked essential personal protective equipment needed to maintain personal hygiene. The team took initiative by reaching out to homeless shelters needing more equipment. In each hygiene kit, we packed toothbrushes, shampoo, body wash, body spray, and many more necessities.  </p>

            <p style="width: 70%; text-align:center; font-size: 22; margin-left: 13%; line-height: 2.5;"> Having adequate clothing is an essential part of our day to day lives. Unexpected weather changes are unavoidable, and without necessary clothing, we are left with potential detrimental health effects. Rather than throwing out their clothes, the team donated them to a local goodwill. Donating items like sweatshirts, shorts and pants, the team gave the underprivileged clothing for all types of weather. </p>

            <p style="width: 70%; text-align:center; font-size: 22; margin-left: 13%; line-height: 2.5;"> Food, despite seeming extremely common, can be a luxury for many. Texas has a food security percentage of 18.4%, which is higher than the national food security percentage by 7.9%. The North Texas Food Bank works to reduce that number, by donating fresh, packaged meals to the underprivileged across Texas. Our team volunteered at the food bank during a time of need by packaged food for delivery     </p>
